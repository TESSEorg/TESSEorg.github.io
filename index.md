## Mission

The TESSE Organization develops and maintains software tools for task-based parallel programming in scientific computing at extreme scale. Our work focuses on enabling programmer productivity and portable performance for advanced scientific applications on modern high-performance computing systems, with particular emphasis on irregular and sparse computational patterns.

## Projects

### [Template Task Graph (TTG)](ttg/)

TTG is our flagship C++ API providing a powerful data-flow programming model for high-performance scientific computing. It offers:

* Task-based parallel programming abstraction
* Data-flow execution model for irregular computations
* Portable performance across heterogeneous architectures
* Support for dynamic and adaptive algorithms

[View TTG Documentation](ttg/)

### [EPEXA Project](epexa/)

The Production quality Ecosystem for Programming and Executing eXtreme-scale Applications (EPEXA) was an NSF-supported R&D project that created a production-quality implementation of the TESSE research prototype. The project focused on:

* Completing and hardening the TTG API implementation
* Growing the user community and supporting applications
* Enabling scalable scientific simulation codes
* Supporting modern heterogeneous computing architectures
